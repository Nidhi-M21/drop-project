# Contributing to Drop Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Drop Project! We welcome contributions from everyone — whether it's
reporting bugs, suggesting improvements, or submitting code changes.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Improvements

If you find a bug or have an idea for an improvement,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/drop-project-edu/drop-project/issues/new) on GitHub. When creating an issue:

- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- For improvements, explain the use case and why it would be valuable.

### Contributing Code

All pull requests **must be associated with an existing issue**. This ensures that changes are discussed and agreed upon
before implementation work begins.

1. **Find or create an issue** — Browse [open issues](https://github.com/drop-project-edu/drop-project/issues) for
   something you'd like to work on. If the issue doesn't exist yet, create one first.
2. **Show interest** — If the issue is unassigned, leave a comment expressing your interest and wait for a maintainer to
   assign it to you. This lets others know it's being worked on.
3. **Fork the repository** and create a branch.
4. **Make your changes** (see [development.md](development.md) for setup instructions).
5. **Submit a pull request** referencing the issue (e.g., `Closes #42`).
